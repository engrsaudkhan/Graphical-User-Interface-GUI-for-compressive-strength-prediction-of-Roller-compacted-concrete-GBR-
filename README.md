I have made the GUI public for the usage and improvement of more similar problems and the sole purpose of research and development.

** Made by: 
Muhammad Saud Khan from Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada, and Department of Civil Engineering, COMSATS University Islamabad and Department of Civil Engineering, and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology.

Here are some tips how we have developed the GUI.
1) Python must be installed.
2) relevant libraries must be installed.
-------------------------------------------------------------
